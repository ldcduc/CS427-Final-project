## Brief Introduction of Game
### Idea
Endless run is one of the famous popular game series with some games associated with childhood like Jetpack Joyride, Temple Run, Surfway Surfers, etc. Inspired by that we built a kind of endless run game from an existing asset called Trash Dash. Trash Dash is about a cat wriggling in a small neighborhood looking for fish to eat.


### Features
* My Game can be played on Windows and Web.
* Store points and progress of the player's missions with the corresponding redeemed gifts.
* Choose and buy character.
* Self-generated random mission syste.
* Basic endless run game system with obstacles, rewards, characters and endless map.
* Speed up characters over time to make the game more difficult and more challenging.


### Techniques
* Generate and render endless map generating maps manually and continually appended with script.
* Camera with script using transform called once per frame.
* Character control with Vector3 transform and Mathf.
* Blinking state when character collide with obstacles using Inumerator and StartCoroutine to call it.
* Generate random rewards and obstacles.
* Game Manager to control scene, generate mission and store player data.
* Work with canvas ui interact with game events and characters.
* Save player data and mission progress through file by using BinaryFormatter, FileStream.
* Change and buy player by using Instantiate and Quaternion.
